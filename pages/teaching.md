### 演化计算 Evolutionary Computation
演化计算是基于自然启发算法的一门课程，介绍如何通过模拟生物进化、群体行为等方法解决复杂问题。内容涵盖遗传算法、粒子群优化、蚂蚁算法等，以及理论部分如适应度景观与收敛性原理，帮助理解优化问题的核心机制。我作为教学助理负责答疑及改卷工作。

Evolutionary Computation focuses on nature-inspired algorithms that solve complex problems by mimicking biological evolution and swarm behaviors. The course covers methods like Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimisation, and Ant Colony Optimisation, along with theoretical concepts such as fitness landscapes and convergence, offering insight into optimisation strategies. As a teaching assistant, I am responsible for Q&A and grading assignments.


### 人工智能2 Artificial Intelligence 2
本课程聚焦人工智能在不确定条件下的应用，涵盖解释性机器学习、概率图模型、信息论及计算机视觉等主题。学生将学习如何在数据缺失或不确定的情况下，利用AI进行推理、搜索、优化和学习。我作为教学助理负责答疑及改卷工作。

Students learn advanced AI techniques for inference, search, and optimization when dealing with incomplete or uncertain data. As a teaching assistant, I am responsible for Q&A and grading assignments.


### 计算机辅助校验 Computer-Aided Verification
计算机辅助校验教会学生如何通过模型检测验证系统行为，确保程序的正确性。课程内容包括形式化方法（如时序逻辑、状态转换系统）及验证工具（如SPIN, nuXmv），以及高级技术如基于BDD的符号验证和抽象等。我作为教学助理负责实验课设计教学、答疑及实验类测验的出卷改卷工作。

Computer-Aided Verification teaches students to validate system behaviors using model checking to ensure correctness. Topics include formal methods (e.g., temporal logic, state transition systems) and tools like nuSMV, along with advanced techniques like symbolic verification with BDDs and abstraction. As a teaching assistant, I am responsible for designing and teaching lab sessions, Q&A, and designing and grading lab-related assignments.


### 数据科学算法 Algorithms for Data Science 
本课程介绍数据科学中的核心算法，包括线性回归、逻辑回归、决策树及随机森林等方法。此外，学生还将学习聚类（如K均值）与降维技术（如PCA），帮助理解数据分析与建模的基础。我作为教学助理负责答疑及改卷工作。

This course introduces fundamental algorithms in data science, such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Students also explore clustering (e.g., K-means) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) techniques essential for data analysis and modeling. As a teaching assistant, I am responsible for Q&A and grading assignments.

### 硕士毕业项目 MSc Projects
硕士项目是学生独立开展研究或开发软件的重要阶段。学生将应用所学知识，深入探索计算机科学领域的特定问题，完成一项独立项目，并展示研究成果。我作为教学助理指导学生使用Git、LaTeX、编程及协助学生与导师、学校交流。

MSc Projects are a vital part of the program where students independently conduct research or develop software in computer science. This final semester focuses on applying learned knowledge to solve specific problems and present meaningful outcomes. As a teaching assistant, I guide students in using Git, LaTeX, and programming, as well as assist them in communicating with the supervisor and the university.

## Other Teaching Experience

### K12计算机教育 / GCSE & A-Level Computing

[Ark St Alban's](https://arkstalbans.org/)是英国伯明翰一所涵盖小学至高中（A-Level）的学校，我曾在该校进行一学期的教学实践，负责三个层次的计算机课程教学：八年级、A-Level第一年及中小学课后编程俱乐部。
 - 八年级课程主要聚焦于学习一门常用编程语言Python的基础知识。作为助教，我在课堂中协助维持纪律并解答学生的疑问。
 - A-Level第一年的Computing课程涵盖基础数据结构与算法（如二分搜索、冒泡排序）。我主要负责答疑解惑，并曾主讲一节关于加密学趣味知识的课程。
 - 此外，Ark St Alban's还设有课后编程俱乐部，我负责领导活动，为中小学生教授[Scratch编程](https://scratch.mit.edu/)。Scratch是一种通过拖放积木块实现编程的软件，形式丰富、交互简易，非常适合初学者。我教授学生如何使用Scratch制作自己的动画和小游戏。

接触不同基础与学习需求的学生让我能够设计多样化的教学策略与材料，帮助他们在理论与实践之间架起桥梁。

Ark St Alban's is a school in Birmingham, UK, covering education from primary to A-Level. I completed a semester of teaching practice there, participating three levels of computing courses: Year 8, A-Level Year 1, and an after-school programming club. Year 8 course focused on introducing Python, where I managed discipline and helped answer students’ questions. The A-Level Year 1 Computing course covered fundamental data structures and algorithms (e.g., bubble sort). My role was to provide support for students’ queries. I also delivered a lesson on the basics of cryptography. For after-school programming club, I design a [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) module to teach students how to create their own animations and games.

### 编程入门 Teaching beginners for programming

本人在高中和大学期间为同学、朋友及晚辈亲戚提供无偿的编程入门辅导，教Pascal、C++、Java、Python和Haskell。同时，在伯明翰大学本科及硕士期间，本人运营了一个编程俱乐部，为学弟学妹提供补习服务，帮助他们巩固基础知识并适应全英文教学环境。
计算机科学的入门常常令初学者感到困难（这在计算机系本科大一挂科率居高不下中尤为体现），因为它需要学生转变思维模式，掌握程序化的逻辑和抽象能力。我在教学中注重逐步引导学生构建计算思维，帮助他们理解数据结构与算法的核心概念，并学会将其应用于实际问题。

During high school and university, I provided free programming tutorials in languages like Pascal, C++, Java, Python, and Haskell to peers and younger students. At university, I ran a programming club to help international students strengthen their foundations and adapt to English-based learning.
Beginners often struggle with computer science because it requires developing computational thinking, which is challenging for many. My teaching focused on gradually building this skill, ensuring students understood core concepts like data structures and algorithms and could apply them effectively.

## Student Projects  <a name="projects"></a>

My primary research interests lie in multi-objective optimisation, evolutionary computation and their applications. I am also interested in multi-agent models, artifical life and its intersection with computational STSE (science, technology, socity and environment).

If students are interested in conducting research/programming projects relate to the aboves, free feel to contact me.
I would be happy to provide project ideas and support.

See a list of possible projects:

1. Combinatorial optimisation
 - Develop randomised algorithms for (single/multiobjective) combinatorial optimisation problems. 
 - Compare algorithms on a problem (class)
 - When and what search operators being effective?
 - What are the characteristics of a problem (class)
 - Data visualisation, for better understanding of algorithms/problems
```
A list of classic/emerging problems:
 KP (Knapsack Problems)
 NK-Landscape problem
 TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem)
 VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem), and a common variation: CVRP (Capicitated VRP)
 JSSP (Job-Shop Scheduling Problem) and a common variation: FJSSP (Flexible JSP)
 RAP (Resource Allocation Problem)
 QAP (Quadratic Assignment Problem)
 Bin Packing
 TTP (Travelling Thief Problem)
 etc
```
 - Continuous problems with very complicated fitness landscape (e.g., Gallagher 101 peaks) is also welcome, since they share similar characteristics with combinatorial problems

2. Multi-criterion decision making. 
 - How to select a representative subset of solutions for the decision maker, especially for many-objective problems?
 - How to quickly locate 1~3 solutions after few Yes/No or ABCD questions?
 - When to add what constraint for easier decision making?
 
3. Aritificial life and Agent based modelling
 - Agent-based simulation with simple agent rules, emerging interesting phenomenon (e.g., Stock market crash, Social hierachy, etc) 
 - Similation of evolutionary systems (e.g., Life history evolution)
 - Similation of survival/evolution of a specific specie, discussing their relationship with human (Cross-discipline of Artificial life and STSE)
 
4. Art and Procedural Content Generation
 - How to generate untrivial visual art patterns and designs with chaotic series (i.e., fractal based pattern generation)? 
 - How to generate untrivial visual art patterns and designs with population-based algorithms?
 - How to generate story with multi-agent system?
 - How to generate story with multi-objective population-based algorithms? 
 - Develop/extend content generation platform: I am primarily exploring story generation with [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/), but extending tools like [Tracery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery/tree/tracery2) is also welcome.
