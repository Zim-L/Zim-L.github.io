My research interests principally lie in **multi-objective optimisation**. This includes both practical and theoretical aspects.

On the practical side, I am interested in widely encountered **real-world** problems that are **difficult** to tackle. These problems might be highly constrained, have many local optima, or possess a deceptive landscape. The tasks of interest include quickly identifying problem characteristics, selecting appropriate algorithms, and adjusting algorithmic configurations according to the computational budget to achieve good results efficiently.

On the theoretical side, I am interested in the **fundamentals** of multi-objective optimisation. For example, how do algorithmic components contribute to the optimisation process? How are some algorithms fundamentally different from others? Similarly, how are problems fundamentally different from one another? With rigorous analysis, visualisation, and fitness landscape analysis, we may identify the key challenges in optimisation problems and thereby tackle them effectively.
